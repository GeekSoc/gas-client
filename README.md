# GeekSoc Account System (GAS)

The GeekSoc Account System (GAS) is a web frontend to our LDAP database. It communicates to the LDAP database through the [gas-api](http://github.com/geeksoc/gas-api).

##Purpose
There are three primary use cases for GAS:
* Allow new members to register for accounts
* All existing members to manage their account details, change password
etc.
* Allow administrators to add/edit and delete accounts and groups

These are all currently implemented in GAS.

implemented. These can be found on [Mantis][2].
